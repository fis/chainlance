<h3>Software</h3>
<p>
	This hill runs on the <code>gearlanced</code> tool, glued to IRC with a bit of Ruby.
	You can find (almost) all the pertinent source code at <a href="https://github.com/fis/chainlance/">https://github.com/fis/chainlance/</a>.
</p>
<h3>Supported scoring methods</h3>
<h4>Definitions</h4>
<p>
	Let $N$ be the number of programs on the hill, and $T$ be the total number of different tape-length and polarity configurations.
	On this hill, $T=42$, from 21 tape lengths (10 to 30), and the <em>sieve</em> and <em>kettle</em> polarities.
</p>
<p>
	Let $P = \{1, 2, \dots, N\}$ be the set of programs, and $a \in P, b \in P$ be two arbitrary programs.
</p>
<p>
	Let $\mat{r}_{a,b} = \begin{bmatrix} r_{a,b}^{(1)} &amp; \cdots &amp; r_{a,b}^{(T)} \end{bmatrix}$ be the result vector of program $a$ battling program $b$.
	For a particular tape length/polarity configuration $i$,
	\[ r_{a,b}^{(i)} = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll} +1 &amp; \text{if $a$ wins,} \\ 0 & \text{if the match is a tie,} \\ -1 &amp; \text{if $a$ loses.} \end{array} \right. \]
	As a shorthand, define the <em>win margin</em> $r_{a,b} = \sum_{i=1}^T r_{a,b}^{(i)}$, where $r_{a,b} \in [-T,T]$.
	Some identities (due to e.g. symmetry of BF Joust):
	\[ \begin{aligned}
	r_{a,b}^{(i)} &amp;= -r_{b,a}^{(i)} &amp; r_{a,a}^{(i)} &amp;= 0 \\
	r_{a,b} &amp;= -r_{b,a} &amp; r_{a,a} &amp;= 0
	\end{aligned} \]
</p>
<p>
	Finally, define the <em>points</em> $p_a$ of program $a$ as
	\[ \begin{aligned}
	p_a &amp;= \frac{1}{T} \sum_{b \in P} r_{a,b}
	&amp;
	p_a &amp;\in [-(N-1), N-1]
	\end{aligned} \]
</p>
<p>
	Let $s_a$ be the final score of program $a$.
	The hill knows of the following metrics to define $s_a$.
</p>
<h4>Markov scoring</h4>
<p>
	The standard scoring mechanism (used to define the hill ranking) is the <em>Markov score</em>.
	Conceptually, each program is allocated a uniform score, and for each battle between programs, both programs wager a fraction of $\frac{1}{N}$ of their score.
	If $a$ wins over $b$, $a$ is given a portion of $\frac{1}{T}$ of $b$'s wager based on each win.
	In case of a tie, both programs keep their own scores.
	This process is then iterated until it reaches a stationary point, and those are the final scores.
</p>
<p>
	Define a first-order Markov chain with a transition probability $t_{a,b}$ (for $a \not= b$) of
	\[ t_{a,b} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^T \max(0, r_{b,a}^{(i)})}{NT}. \]
	Set the self-transition probability $t_{a,a}$ to
	\[ t_{a,a} = 1 - \sum_{b \in P,\ b \not= a} t_{a,b} \]
	so that the transition matrix is stochastic.
</p>
<p>
	Let $p(a)$ be the stationary distribution reached from the uniform initial distribution.
	To get numbers more closely approximating the traditional scores, we set the Markov score $s_a$ of a program to
	\[ s_a = 1000 \frac{p(a)}. \]
</p>
<p>
	(Note that this can be implemented by locating the eigenvector of the transition matrix $[\mat{T}]_{ab} = t_{a,b}$ with an eigenvalue of 1, since a stationary distribution $\mat{p}$ has $\mat{p} = \mat{p} \mat{T}$.
	In practice, there is always a single unique stationary distribution.)
</p>
<h4>Traditional (and tweaked traditional) scoring</h4>
<p>
	The "traditional" scoring is based on the (now defunct?) <a href="http://codu.org/eso/bfjoust/">codu.org hill</a>; see the <a href="http://codu.org/eso/bfjoust/SCORES">SCORES</a> document there for exact details.
</p>
<p>
	The <em>worth</em> $w_a$ of program $a$ is $w_a = \frac{p_a + N}{2(N-1)}$ ($w_a \in [1, 2N-1]$ and the average worth is $N$).
</p>
<p>
	The <em>base score</em> $b_a$ is computed as
	\[ b_a = \sum_{b \in p,\ r_{a,b} > 0} w_b \, f(r_{a,b}, T); \]
	that is, for each program $b$ that $a$ beats (positive win margin $r_{a,b}$), some fraction (given by function $f$) of $b$'s worth is included in $a$'s base score.
	This operation explicitly gives more emphasis on winning against "strong" programs.
</p>
<p>
	The traditional scoring uses the simple weight function $f(r, T) = \frac{r}{T}$, where low-margin wins are not considered significantly different from ties.
	The "tweaked" form uses $f(r, T) = \frac{r+T}{2T}$ instead; this gives more weight to the act of winning, with a "full win" ($r=T$) considered only approximately twice as good as a slight win.
<p>
	The final score is scaled to the $[0, 100]$ range and defined as
	\[ s_a = \frac{200 b_a}{N-1}. \]
</p>
<h4>Iterated (and tweaked iterated) scoring</h4>
<p>
	Inspired by the traditional scoring, but iterated until convergence to a fixed point.
</p>
<p>
	Define initial score vector $\mat{s}^{(0)} = \begin{bmatrix} s_1^{(0)} &amp; \cdots &amp; s_N^{(0)} \end{bmatrix}$,
	\[ s_a^{(0)} = \frac{p_a + N - 1}{2(N - 1)}. \]
	Note that $\left\| \mat{s}^{(0)} \right\|_1 = \frac{N}{2}$.
	Also define the <em>positive win margin matrix</em> $\mat{D}$,
	\[ [\mat{D}]_{ab} = \max(0, \frac{r_{a,b}}{T}). \]
</p>
<p>
	Define recursively
	\[ \begin{aligned}
	\mat{u}^{(i)} &amp;= \mat{D} \mat{s}^{(i-1)}, \\
	\mat{s}^{(i)} &amp;= \frac{N}{2 \left\| \mat{u}^{(i)} \right\|_1} \mat{u}^{(i)}.
	\end{aligned} \]
</p>
<p>
	Iterate until $\mat{s}^{(j)} \approx \mat{s}^{(j-1)}$.
	Final scores are then
	\[ s_a = 100 s_a^{(j)}. \]
</p>
<p>
	The tweaked version is again otherwise identical, with the exception of using $\frac{r_{a,b}+T}{2T}$ in matrix $\mat{D}$ (again only for winning programs).
</p>
